# Hi there! I'm Md Abrar Hasan

#### ***A young computer programmer who is so enthusiastic about Web Development and interested in building a fruitful career in this demanding sector.***

🔧 Skills: **React / JS / HTML / CSS / Tailwind**

As an enthusiast in web development, I gained expertise in the field of front-end through my time, talent, and effort. My toolkit includes essential languages and frameworks such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, alongside cutting-edge technologies like React, MongoDB, Node.js, Express.js, and Firebase. These skills were honed during my tenure as an apprentice at Programming Hero, where I actively contributed to diverse projects, infusing them with functionality and creativity.

📖 I am concurrently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at **Brac University**, with an anticipated graduation date in 2025. My academic pursuits serve as a solid foundation for my aspirations to become a quality developer.

🎯 Since my future plan is to shift from a front-end developer to a full-stack developer, I am passionate about the backend sector besides the front-end. Also, I am intrigued by the evolving landscape of AI and aspire to integrate my skills into this burgeoning field. My ultimate goal is to leverage my combined knowledge of web development and AI to create innovative solutions that shape the future of technology.

🔍 Currently, I am eagerly seeking internship opportunities to further enhance my expertise and broaden my professional horizons.
